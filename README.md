# SpacoR
R version of [BrainStOrmics/Spaco](https://github.com/BrainStOrmics/Spaco).


# Development
We are still working on a pure-R implementation for Spaco.

At this stage, please refer to our [demo](https://github.com/BrainStOrmics/SpacoR/blob/main/R_Demo.ipynb) for using Spaco 
with Seurat and to call Spaco's python version from R via the reticulate package.
