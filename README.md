## Tutorial
- Please see our [**STAR Protocol**](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.xpro.2024.103062) for detailed description
- Please refer to the simple [SpacoR_demo](https://github.com/BrainStOrmics/SpacoR/blob/main/vignettes/SpacoR_demo.ipynb) for using SpacoR with Seurat

  
# Development
**We are still working on this pure-R implementation for Spaco.**

At this stage, several functions and features are not yet implemented in our R version of Spaco. You may refer to 
[Spaco_reticulate_demo](https://github.com/BrainStOrmics/SpacoR/blob/main/vignettes/Spaco_reticulate_demo.ipynb) for 
calling Spaco's python version from R via the reticulate package.
