# Development
**We are still working on this pure-R implementation for Spaco.**

At this stage, please refer to the simple [SpacoR_demo](https://github.com/BrainStOrmics/SpacoR/blob/main/vignettes/SpacoR_demo.ipynb) for using Spaco 
with Seurat,

or to our [Spaco_reticulate_demo](https://github.com/BrainStOrmics/SpacoR/blob/main/vignettes/Spaco_reticulate_demo.ipynb) for calling Spaco's python version from R via the reticulate package.
